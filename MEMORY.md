## 📜 CORE PROTOCOLS

1.  **Language**: **ENGLISH ONLY**. All code, comments, plans, and documentation must remain in English to maintain global standard consistency.
2.  **Skill Discovery**: Before implementing complex logic, check `SKILLS INDEX.md` and `custom-skills/claude-agent-skills/` to leverage existing domain expertise.
3.  **Security**: Adhere to the `SECURITY_SKILLS_FRAMEWORK.md`. No secrets in logs; SAST/DAST before deployment.
4.  **Version Control**: Atomic commits; tag stable releases; follow the `CHANGELOG.md` for major architectural shifts.

## 🎯 AGENT BEHAVIOR

- **Initial Analysis**: Silently detect domains (Frontend, Backend, Security) and apply specialized knowledge via `@intelligent-routing`.
- **Socratic Gate**: For multi-pillar or structural changes, ask 3 strategic questions before implementation.
- **Proactive Coder**: Create PRs during nightly build cycles (11 PM EST) for user review.
