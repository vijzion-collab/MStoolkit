# Letter B: The "Goodwill/Accuracy Hybrid" (For Self/Atlantic)

**To**: Experian Consumer Assistance  
**RE**: Erroneous Payment History - Account #CBA000XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Dear Experian,

I am writing concerning the SELF/ATLANTIC CAPITAL account, which inaccurately displays late payments from January and February 2023. Discrepancies occurred with "Self," affecting the automated drafts. 

Please reevaluate the actual transaction dates; if they cannot be verified against the grace period, the derogatory marks must be corrected to show "Current/Never Late." 

Kindly amend this account to reflect a flawless payment history as it is now closed.

Regards,  
Stefan Lewis
