# Letter A: The "Accuracy Audit" (For Capital One)

**To**: Experian Consumer Assistance  
**RE**: Dispute of Inaccurate Information - Account #517805XXXXXX

To Whom It May Concern,

I am formally disputing the accuracy of the CAPITAL ONE account on my credit report dated Feb 9, 2026. This account is documented as "Account previously in dispute - investigation complete," yet the balance and status dates conflict with my records. The "Status Updated" and "Balance Updated" dates create discrepancies indicative of mismanagement.

As per FCRA requirements, if you cannot furnish verifiable data within 30 days, you are obligated to delete this account from my file.

Regards,  
Stefan Lewis
