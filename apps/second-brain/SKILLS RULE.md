# SKILLS RULE

## Overview
This rule defines how LLM agents should interact with the skills defined in this repository.

## Execution Priority
1. **Local AGENTS.md**: Repository-level guidelines take first precedence.
2. **Specific Skill Files**: When a task maps to a defined skill (e.g., PDF processing), follow the `SKILL.md` instructions strictly.
3. **Global Guidelines**: Follow project-wide conventions for naming, directory structure, and technology stack.

## Skill Discovery
Before starting a complex task, scan `SKILLS INDEX.md` to identify available capabilities that can optimize the workflow.
