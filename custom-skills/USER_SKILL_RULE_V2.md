# USER_SKILL_RULE_V2

## Skill Template
Every new skill should follow this exact format:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Third-person description with trigger phrases. Use when...
---

# Skill Content

Instructions, patterns, and best practices...
```

## Best Practices
- **Third-Person Description**: Write the description as an outside observer explaining what the skill does.
- **Trigger Phrases**: Include "Use when..." or "Triggered by..." to help the agent identify when to activate the skill.
- **Focussed Scope**: Each skill should handle a single, well-defined domain.
- **Clear Instructions**: Use headers and lists to make the skill content easy to follow.
